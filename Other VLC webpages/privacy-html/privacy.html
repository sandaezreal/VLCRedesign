             Before or after you enter into an agreement with us, the files of credit reference agencies will be searched and they will record these enquiries. It may be necessary for us to approach more than one lender or finance house from our panel of providers to have credit facilities agreed and this may result in several credit searches being registered on your credit file. If you are a company or partnership, these searches will also be made in respect of any of your directors or partners. Disclosure may be made to these agencies with details about you and your conduct under any agreement arranged by or with us. These details may then be used to help make credit decisions on you or (if you are an individual) members of your household, or to help prevent fraud, to trace debtors or to help recover our property.
